You can choose between three programs in order of developing the final application.
Please note that for realizing the exam presentation you must apply to only one 
program: Cooling or Particles2D or Particles3D. Unfortunately there is no Fortran
version for Particles3D.
These are but just toy programs: please let us know if you found some programming 
errors.

Would you please read the README.txt files in the relevant directory before start 
working.
